    "body": "Release 2.1.0\r\n\r\n**Enhancements**\r\n- Added pre-rendered tooltip previews for built-in materials.\r\n- Shortcuts are now viewable in the tile editor.\r\n- Added option to view camera numbers.\r\n- Added camera multiselect.\r\n- Added option to change which layers prop selection chooses from.\r\n- Warped prop textures are now warped correctly.\r\n- Updated Drizzle to v0.2.0.11\r\n- Added option to use the old control for prop creation.\r\n- Added \"Maroon\" theme. (Fun Fact: it's from Soundbox, one of my other projects.)\r\n- Decreased CPU usage while program is unused.\r\n  - More specifically, the program stops processing until user input is received after a short period of user inactivity. Certain scenarios have exceptions.\r\n\r\n**Fixes**\r\n- Fixed crash occuring when loading large tile textures.\r\n- Fixed the \"unknown texture\" texture.\r\n- Direct3D shader compatibility fix.\r\n- Now correctly registers skipped palette entries for custom palettes added to `assets/palettes`.\r\n  - On that note, I also added the MSC palettes.\r\n- Fixed visual bug in regards to incorrectly determined stray tile fragments.\r\n- Fixed mirroring while erasing in the geometry editor.\r\n\r\nNo fix for the still occuring problem of Rained not launching due to stupid graphics libraries not working. Found a fix for it (i.e. switching to a different library that I confirmed worked with a \"victim\"). But it will take a while. Despite it only happening to a few people, it still bugs me (unintended pun). I am starting to regret programming this in C# .NET Core.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pkhead/rained/compare/v2.0.4...v2.1.0"
